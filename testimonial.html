      <h1>TESTIMONIALS</h1>

      <div class="testimony testimonial-1">
        <blockquote>What makes Zach Stonerock a “great” trainer? He truly cares about his clients. I have been very impressed by his passion to help his clients, his knowledge, and his ability to connect with his clients. When I started personal training with Zach I knew immediately that he could help me achieve my goals and help make a positive change in my life. I have been motived, challenged, and pushed just hard enough to achieve results with each training session. He makes working out fun and inspires me to reach new goals. Kudos to Zach for helping to get this 56 year old women in shape and healthy! Highly recommended!

        <blockquote>I started working out with Zach a month ago and have seen the changes! The first workout I knew I had a long way to go. I am quicker with the workouts we do and I am increasing the difficulty of the strength exercises. Zach is patient and knows what he is doing. He know how to modify a workout if someone is really struggling and is encouraging through the whole process. His workouts are fun and different each session!

      <div class="testimony testimonial-3">
        <blockquote>I wanted to thank you for all the hard work and dedication that you have put in with my son Shamari Christian. Since you have started working with him last summer, he has improved in all aspects of football. He has become faster, more agile and leaner with the precise workout plan that you designed for him. The technique work that you put in with him is on display every time he takes the field. He shows huge improvements every game and those improvements in stamina, agility, and speed led to him being selected Lineman of the Year for his team. All those things are great, but the greatest attribute of the whole thing is the connection that you made with Shamari. He loves working with you and he is always excited to learn what you are teaching. You have went the extra mile by coming to his games and checking on his school work,supporting Shamari wherever you can. He is more then just a client and I truly appreciate all the time that you have dedicated to his improvement.Again, I thank you and look forward even more great work this year.
