        <p>Personal trainers are a dime a dozen anymore, so I'm sure you're asking what sets me apart. I'm not your stereotypical trainer, meaning you won't see me in any magazine covers anytime soon for my physique. I share a lot of the same daily struggles and obstacles that you do. What I bring is a scientific approach to help develop a plan for YOU. I don't buy into the "bro-science" techniques. Whether you want to train with me 7 days a week or once a month I'm always available as a resource to guide you along the way to achieving your goals. I will hold you to a high standard. I give each of my clients 100% so I expect the same effort in return. I don't do this to get rich, I do this because it's a passion and I want to share that passion with others.</p>

      <hr>
      <h4>OWNER <span class="blue">|</span> COACH</h4>
      <p>My name is Zach Stonerock and I'm a certified personal trainer in the Central Ohio area. Through the National Academy of Sports Medicine, I have obtained my Certified Personal Trainer certificate and my Performance Enhancement Specialization. My areas of focus are in weight loss, strength training, conditioning, youth fitness, and sport specific training. My life is sports. When I'm not working with a client, you can find me playing basketball, watching my favorite sports teams, or coaching youth basketball. I look forward to interacting and building relationships with all of you. Until then, keeping working towards your goals. Talk to you soon!</p>

    <p>What makes Zach Stonerock a “great” trainer? He truly cares about his clients. I have been very impressed by his passion to help his clients, his knowledge, and his ability to connect with his clients. When I started personal training with Zach I knew immediately that he could help me achieve my goals and help make a positive change in my life. I have been motived, challenged, and pushed just hard enough to achieve results with each training session. He makes working out fun and inspires me to reach new goals. Kudos to Zach for helping to get this 56 year old women in shape and healthy! Highly recommended! <br><cite class="review__cite">&mdash;Jamie</cite></p>
